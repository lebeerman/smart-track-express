A basic CRUD app

- For production you would need to run yarn build inside the client directory, then CRA will create a build directory with the production build. Back to the server.js file, require path and add the following line
```
app.use(‘/’, express.static(`${__dirname}/client/build`));
```
Take a look at [this repo](https://github.com/esausilva/quick-node-server/blob/master/server.js) for reference, in this example I show how to serve static files with node, which is basically what you need.

Now to deploy to Heroku you need to take several steps, Stephen Grider does an excellent job in [this video](https://youtu.be/Ru3Rj_hM8bo) detailing the process on deploying to Heroku.
